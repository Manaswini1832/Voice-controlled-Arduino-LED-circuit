# Voice-controlled-Arduino-LED-circuit

There are two components to this project

- Python speech to text conversion : Referred to [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/easy-speech-to-text-with-python-3df0d973b426) article
- Arduino lighting up the right LED according to the speech input : Referred to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm_xfm1d5h0) video to solve errors

## Voice commands

`Yes` : Switches the Green LED on
`No` : Switches the Red LED on
`close` : Switches all the LEDs off and exits the program
